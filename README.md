# Image_classification
This branch contains the implementations of a simple classifier, a hypernetwork for it and a genetic algorithm


The implementation of a simple classifier for the MNIST dataset is using tensorflow 2.3.0, keras 2.4.3, numpy 1.18.5.

NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT CLEANED UP AND IM NOT SURE IF ALL OF THIS WORKS. 

I will upload the code now so i'll feel forced to work on it and not continue with other stuff first. I'll add some trained models once I have them.
